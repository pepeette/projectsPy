# projectsPy
A list of small projects on python, that I will create to refresh my code

. DiceRoll.py will allow you to create a virtual dice
it can be tweaked to student calling, raising their hand

. quotes.py searches through a json file of authors and said quotes
it allows to search authors even if mistyped name
and it allows to return multiple quotes from them
